# Keycloak / Single Sign-on

Cluster Auditor is not an application you log into directly as a user, rather it is just a specilized metrics collector that ships data to Prometheus/Grafana. Metrics are available to view in Grafana which itself is configurable for SSO, the docs for which are available [here](https://repo1.dso.mil/platform-one/big-bang/apps/core/monitoring/-/blob/main/docs/KEYCLOAK.md).
