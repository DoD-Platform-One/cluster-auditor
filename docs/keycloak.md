# Keycloak / Single Sign-on

Cluster Auditor is not an application you log into directly as a user, rather it is just a specilized log collector that ships logs to Elasticsearch. These logs are available to view in Kibana which itself is configurable for SSO, the docs for which are available [here](https://repo1.dso.mil/platform-one/big-bang/apps/core/elasticsearch-kibana/-/blob/main/docs/keycloak.md).
